## Business Understanding
Road Accidents have always been a major and severe cause/contributor in accidental deaths. They have been increasing in severity and frequency due to the proliferation of more sophisticated and advanced vehicles that can reach upto phenomenal speeds on the highways. There are a lot of external factors that have the potential of aggravating road accidents' severity and resulting casualities. The varying road conditions, weather conditions, pecularities of particular locations and traffic signs and systems are some of them. There is a persisting opportunity gap that can be leveraged by using past data about road accidents and collisions to build a prediction system of some sorts that can point in the direction of possible accidental conditions, especially the severity or the possibility of the extent of damage, and can help save lives. I believe, such a solution would be appealing to not just the concerned people themselves, but also to the emergency services, medical facilites and institutions, highway authorities and the government. This solution will guide the aforementioned authorities to be better and more appropriately prepared(depending on the severity of the accident) for any possible calamities that might occur on the road in the future.
